Incorrect - Binding theory. Usually, if an object pronoun stands in for the subject of a sentence, this is marked with a reflexive pronoun. The absense of this marker in this sentence indicates to a human listener that "them" and "they" do not refer to the same objects.

Incorrect - Selectional restrictions. The human listener will understand from the context that the scientists are administering treatment for a disease in sentence 1 and understand that the affliction in sentence 2 (sepsis) relates to the recipients of the treatment (mice) rather than the administors of the treatment (scientists).
